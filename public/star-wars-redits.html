        An introduction to the use of Objects to store data and behavior, the concept of key-value pairs, passing objects into functions, but also functions inside of objects!

Topics
Primitive data types
Objects Fundamentals
Their advantages for data lookup vs arrays
How they are passed to functions
Functions as object methods
Using this when inside an object's function
You'll notice that while this week has more new concepts (every week will), our approach to teaching with you will adjust a bit. Overall as the weeks progress there is lesser emphasis on giving you all the resources, functions, tips that you need to complete an activity, and more expectation of you to poke around until you find an answer.

This means that during lecture if/when a new concept comes up that you don't fully understand, consider writing it down and researching it post-lecture. There are too many new things that you'll encounter directly or tangentially in morning lecture for everyone to ask "What's XYZ?". That is a question for Google before it should become one for us. We're happy to discuss XYZ with you once you've spent some time trying to understand it for yourself.
Writing maintainable CSS is tough, and comes with experience. Not everyone is good at it, even at LHL. Use mentors for code reviewing your CSS.
Writing CSS that works well across all browsers used to be a nightmare, but is much less problematic now.
CSS Box model is the focus for today, and it still has many confusion parts, many hacks. You'll encounter some this week. For this reason, you really need to (especially at first) "poke things until they work"
Flexbox aims to correct this by rewriting how we layout the page.
CSS Grid is even newer than Flexbox. It is something you can learn on your own (and it is recommended that you do so).
Since HTML/CSS has so many subtopics, set their priority for what to focus on or what to avoid (eg: "don't worry about *:before, *:after")
